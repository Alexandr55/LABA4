There is no clear boundary, the atmosphere is discharged gradually as the distance from the Earth's surface, and there is still no consensus on what should be considered the beginning of the space factor. If the temperature is constant, the pressure would have changed exponentially from 100 kPa at sea level to zero. International Aeronautical Federation as working the border between the atmosphere and space to set the height of 100 km (Karman line), because at this height to create a lifting aerodynamic force is necessary, that the aircraft was moving at orbital velocity, due to which defeats the purpose of aviapol¸ta. Astronomers from the United States and Canada border have measured the effects of atmospheric winds and the onset of exposure to cosmic rays. She was at an altitude of 118 kilometers, although the NASA considered the boundary of space 122 kilometers. At this altitude, the shuttle switch from normal maneuvering with only aerodynamic rocket engines with "support" in the atmosphere.Error readingError reading
